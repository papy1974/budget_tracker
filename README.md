# Objective and Description.

Using a previously created Budget Tracker application, a user is able to update information while online/offline. The updated application has offline access and functionality. The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, the total will be populated when brought back online.Summary This project emphasizes the use of PWA using service-worker.js, manifest.jason on an existing app that uses MongoDB, mongoose, morgan, and express, to dynamically update a budget track app.
